## Building for Android with Capacitor

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16 or higher
- Android Studio
- Android SDK

### Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the React app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Add Android platform (if not already added):
   ```bash
   npx cap add android
   ```

4. Update Android configuration for landscape mode:
   The app is configured to run in landscape mode by default.

5. Build and open Android project:
   ```bash
   npm run build-android
   ```

### Landscape Orientation
The app is configured to run in landscape mode on Android devices through:
1. Capacitor configuration in `capacitor.config.json`
2. AndroidManifest.xml configuration with `screenOrientation="landscape"`
3. CSS media queries for responsive design

### Database Storage
The application now includes local database storage using Capacitor Storage:
- Employee data (login credentials, roles, etc.)
- Inventory items (products, stock levels, categories)
- Transaction history (sales records, receipts)

All data is persisted locally on the device and survives app restarts.

### Network Broadcasting
Data can be broadcast to other devices on the same network:
1. Enable broadcasting in Settings > Network
2. Configure broadcast interval
3. Use manual sync or auto-sync options
4. No server required - peer-to-peer communication

### Building the APK
After running `npm run build-android`, Android Studio will open. From there:
1. Select "Build" â†’ "Generate Signed Bundle / APK"
2. Choose "APK" and follow the wizard
3. The generated APK will be in the `android/app/release/` directory
